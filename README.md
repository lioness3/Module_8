*Integrates C++ and Python*. 

*Joann Carter*

This is a grocery tracker that integrates C++ and Python. Python is used to search through text from a file and C++ is used for interface. This program reads and writes files, produces a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased, determines the frequency of a specific item, and/or outputs a histogram. 
This app successfuly integrates both languages. Improvements could be made in the logic behind converting a second character to an integer. example: anything over 9. converting C++ characters to integers was a challenge for me. This conversion was needed inorder to create the histrogram from text input read from grocery frequency file. Using methods from Python libraries woud be a better idea to produce a histogram. 
Overall, the comments thrpoughout the code make this a maintable and readable program. It is also adaptable through the dynamic use of file inout reading. This is a great project to use in the future for C++ and Pythion integration.
