1.Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?


This is a grocery tracker that integrates C++ and Python. Python is used to search through text from a file and C++ is used for interface. This program reads and writes files, produces a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased, determines the frequency of a specific item, and/or outputs a histogram. 
This app successfuly integrates both languages. Improvements could be made in the logic behind converting a second character to an integer. example: anything over 9. converting C++ characters to integers was a challenge for me. This conversion was needed inorder to create the histrogram from text input read from grocery frequency file. Using methods from Python libraries woud be a better idea to produce a histogram. 
Overall, the comments thrpoughout the code make this a maintable and readable program. It is also adaptable through the dynamic use of file inout reading. This is a great project to use in the future for C++ and Pythion integration.
